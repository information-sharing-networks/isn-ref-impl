            <p>This mirror is part of an EoT Border Trade Demonstrator (BTD) ISN. It gathers signals of various
                categories which are syndicated to it by ISN participants to simplify the process for participants
                looking to subscribe to insight published by others.
            </p>
            <p>A number of mirrors may be established as part of an ISN to collect signals for various purposes. Mirrors
                may also act as a store for signal information ensuring redundancy and enduring availability where it is
                necessary.</p>
            <p>For more information on how the ISN works please see the <a href="documentation">documentation</a>.</p>
